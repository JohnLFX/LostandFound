# Lost and Found App

Lost and Found web application designed for theme parks, schools, airports, hospitals, and all other campuses where
having a lost and found inventory system is viable. Made with Vuetify and Vue.js
- [See Live Demo](https://github.com/JohnLFX/LostandFound)

The DBMS is designed for how you want to store the data. As of now, you can only store data locally on your device in
your browser storage. But in the future, it is planned to enable deployment your own on-premise database whether it be
because of policy, regulation, or privacy.

Note that this is an active prototype and was created in a week, I would not say this is production ready and there are
a ton of other features needing to be added. Once I got a good idea of how everything is going to be designed the code
base will look nicer and easier to follow.
